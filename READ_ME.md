## Code Louisville Project

During a session of Code Louisville's Python class, a mentor (Evan Payne) gave a demonstration about the data science/data visualisation that asked whether or not hot weather contributed to an increase in assaults in Louisville. I got me thinking about how some say the full moon is said to effect behaviour, so I thought I'd try to answer the question as to whether or not the fullness of the moon has any effect on the levels of violent crime. Also, Evan was curious about a possible link between car break-ins and the full moon. I thought I'd include burglaries into that query as well.

For this project you'll need:  
1. Software called 'DB Browser For SQLite' which can be found [here](http://sqlitebrowser.org/).

2. You'll probably wanna download some Python software called Anaconda. I know, it's a rather sizeable bit of software, but it'll have everything you need and then some. Some of that stuff you'll need that comes with Anaconda includes:  
    
    * Jupyter Notebook
    * Bokeh
    * Numpy
    * Matplotlib

I've already included. The CSV about Louisville's crime data ( `Crime_Data_2017_1.csv` ) can be found at [Louisville Metro Open Data](https://data.louisvilleky.gov/dataset/crime-data). Just scroll down to the link named `Crime Data 2017`. Now the data on the fullness of the moon is found in a CSV that been included called `Moon_Fraction_Illumination_2017_two_column.csv`. I got this from information found at the US Naval Observatory's website. It has an app that'll give you `<pre>` data that relates to the moons data for any given year. Here's a [link](http://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO/astronomical-applications/astronomical-information-center/phases-percent-moon/).  

Okay, that should be everything. Hope you find the data as interesting as I did.
